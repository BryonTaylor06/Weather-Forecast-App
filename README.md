**Weather Forecast App** is a Java Swing application that provides detailed weather information based on location input. Originally developed as part of a software systems course project, this expanded version adds a full GUI interface to the original command-line weather program.

> The core "WeatherForecast" program was completed in collaboration with **two other students** as part of a mini project for **CSCI-C212: Introduction to Software Systems** at Indiana University during Spring 2025. I just expanded on the idea:)
